MEETING NOTES 20/02

Made some changes to my SAC while comparing to SB3, did not see much change.
I think one change they use which might help still is batch normalization for critics.

Added autoencoder, no dropout, the one training run does not proof to work well yet.

Found in literature about centralized critics:
    - MADDPG (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275v4) (2017) uses a centralized critic for each agent in a multi-agent DDPG algorithm
    - Found some applications of centralized critics.
        - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344036373_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_for_the_Energy_Optimization_of_Cyber-Physical_Production_Systems

Would like to continue with the setting where new agents might be added.

Also found paper that uses multi-headed output as ensemble, might be interesting to couple this with some diversity promoting addition to loss (Diversity via Determinants)

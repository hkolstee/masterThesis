Notes Week 4:

---
Worked on:
- Custom implementation single agent SAC done 24/01
- Improved this implementation with automatic entropy coefficient adjustment (paper: [Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and Applications - Section: Automating Entropy Adjustment for Maximum Entropy RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905))

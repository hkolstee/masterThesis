#### Partially Observable Stochastic Games

Multi-Agent MDPs (MMDP) is an extension of MDPs that includes a set of actions for each agent. This assumes all agents receive the same reward. Stochastic Games / Markov Games, extends this by allowing unique reward functions for each agent. Partially-Observable Stochastic Games (POSG) models extend this to the setting where the state is only partially observable (similar to POMDP).
